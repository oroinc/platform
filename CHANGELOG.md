* Fixed injection of API metadata into filters that implement both `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Filter\MetadataAwareFilterInterface` and `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Filter\FieldAwareFilterInterface` interfaces. From now the parent entity metadata is injected instead of injection the association metadata. So, if a filter implements `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Filter\MetadataAwareFilterInterface` interface the parent entity metadata is injected independ on `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Filter\FieldAwareFilterInterface` interface.

#### LayoutBundle
* Removed `oro_layout.provider.svg_icons_support` service, now it should be used `getThemeOption` method from `oro_layout.theme_manager` service.

- added new tag `oro_operation_service` to gather operation services in a separate service locator
- updated OperationAssembler and Operation to work with services
- Moved acl_resource check to the announce event listener instead of constantly adding it to pre-conditions
- Moved operation feature availability check to the announce event listener instead of constantly adding it to pre-conditions

###### Operation Events

Operation execution events added for better extensibility and control of operation execution flow

##### Action Group Changes

* Added `ActionExecutor` to be able to run actions and action groups from PHP code without a need to work with ActionData, context, PropertyPaths, etc.
* Added `ActionGroupWrapper` to be able to call a service method as an action group. All such services should be added to service locator with tag `oro_action_group_service`. If service needs to add/change some context variables it has to return an array with an appropriate keys. Note that argument names are used to map data from context to method arguments and must be named same to call parameters.
* Moved logic from action groups YAML definitions to PHP services for checkout-related action_groups
* Added ability to define action group as a service + method config parameters
* added `return_value_name` for `action_group` to map value to action group result correctly for action group services

##### Workflow Events

Added workflow events
* `pre_announce`, `announce`. These events are triggered during checking pre-conditions
* `pre_guard`, `guard`. These events are triggered during checking conditions

Next event are triggered during transition execution:
* `start` (workflow)
* `leave` (step)
* `enter` (step)
* `entered` (step)
* `transition` (transition)
* `completed` (transition)

For all events except start 3 events are triggered. `oro_workflow.<event_name>`, `oro_workflow.<workflow_name>.<event_name>` and `oro_workflow.<workflow_name>.<event_name>.<step_name|transition_name>`

* Added `--watch` and `--watch-interval` options to `oro:workflow:definition:load` command to periodically reload the workflow definition(s). Can be used during development to not bother the developer who might forget to reload the definition.

##### ExtendableCondition and ExtendableAction changes

* removed dependency on WorkflowItem/ActionData in listeners which limited those listeners to a place from which event is triggered (workflow definition or action group)
* extracted extendable condition errors processing to a separate service to not depend on the translator and request stack directly
* added ability to trigger checkout events directly using event dispatcher without a need to use extendable action|condition
* introduced determined set of data available in listeners, access to current execution context was limited in order to remove untraceable dependencies on the inner workflow implementations and improve listeners re-usability

##### Configuration import directive filters

* Added `import_condition` (Expression Language syntax same to on used in DI) option for workflow import
* Added import filters that may be registered via `WorkflowConfigurationImportsProcessor::addImportFilter` and should implement the `ImportFilterInterface`

#### ApiBundle
* The `masterRequest` attribute in API context was replaced with `mainRequest`. If you have API processors that use the `masterRequest` attribute in the `oro.api.processor` service tag it should be replaces with the `mainRequest` attribute.
* Changed `\Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Filter\FilterValueAccessorInterface` to be able to use filters by same field but with different operators, e.g. `?filter[id][gt]=1&filter[id][lt]=10`:

  - changed return value for `getAll` method from `array [filter key => FilterValue, ...]` to `array [filter key => [FilterValue, ...], ...]`
* Outdated format of API filters like `filter[id]>=1` is not supported from now, use `filter[field][operator]=value` syntax instead, e.g. `filter[id][gte]=1`.

#### ActionBundle

##### Action Group Changes

* Added ActionExecutor to be able to run actions and action groups from PHP code without a need to work with ActionData, context, PropertyPaths, etc.
* Added ActionGroupWrapper to be able to call a service method as an action group. All such services should be added to service locator with tag oro_action_group_service.

##### Workflow ACL checks

* Moved `acl_resource` check to pre_announce event listener instead of constantly adding it to pre-conditions. After this change, `acl_resource` checks will be done *before* pre-actions. It's no longer possible to reference variables in `acl_resource`, such checks must be moved to pre-conditions.

* Disabled key normalization for `data` attributes of the `button_options` section for operations. Now, using the dash symbol for data attribute naming is possible.

# Oro Enum Changes

Updating the ORO Enum implementation is caused by:

- Read-only permissions for web server user on entity extend files in the system cache.
- Updates to entities from the UI do not require cache updates in the entity management.
- Need to avoid code generation.
- Reduce the number of requests in cases where the object uses join queries with a large number of lists.
- After completion, it will be possible to remove MultiHostBundle on schema update.

## The structure of relationships between entities and storage

*Before:*

- The main storage place for ORO Enums are tables created for each enum. The table name begins with ``oro_enum_``.

Example:

```
oro_enum_auth_status
oro_enum_inventory_status
```

- The connection between a specific enum and a table is created using a relation column. To get the value of the enum,
  you need to make a join in the query.
- The entity configuration stores the relationship between the enum and the target table and the configuration of the
  enum itself.
- There is a difference in configuration for the enum and for the product attribute of the enum.
- All extend enums are inherited from the base one ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\AbstractEnumValue```.

*After:*

- All ORO enums are stored in a table ```oro_enum_option```.
- The connection between the target table that uses the enum and the enum itself is built without a relation. Enum
  values used by entities are stored in the field ```serialized_data```.

- Updated enums are inherited not from the ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\AbstractEnumValue```
  but from ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\EnumOptionInterface```[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

``` json
{
    "inventory_status": "prod_inventory_status.in_stock",
    "multi_enum": ["prod_multi_enum.test_option_1", "prod_multi_enum.test_option_3"]
}
```
## The structure of DB storage

*Before:*

Stored in the generated table, which begins with the prefix "oro_enum_" (that is, each enum has its own table).

Example of enum for "oro_enum_auth_status" table:

```markdown
| id      | name    | priority | is_default |
| reset   | Reset   | 2        | false      |
| locked  | Locked  | 3        | false      |
| expired | Expired | 4        | false      |
| active  | Active  | 1        | true       |
```

*After:*

Stored in the "oro_enum_option" table.

Example:

```markdown
| id                  | internal_id | enum_code   | name    | priority | is_default |
| auth_status.locked  | locked      | auth_status | Locked  | 3        | false      |
| auth_status.expired | expired     | auth_status | Expired | 4        | false      |
| auth_status.active  | active      | auth_status | Active  | 1        | true       |
| auth_status.reset   | reset       | auth_status | Reset   | 2        | false      |
```

## Versioned migration Enum changes:

- To avoid breaking versioned migrations, it is advisable to use the appropriate methods when creating enums for the old binding.

*Before:*

```php
    $queries->addPostQuery(
        new InsertEnumValuesQuery(
            $this->extendExtension,
            'cu_auth_status', 
            [new EnumDataValue(CustomerUserAuthStatus::STATUS_EXPIRED, 'Expired', 3)]
        )
     );
```

```php
namespace Oro\Bundle\CalendarBundle\Migrations\Schema\v1_0;

class OroCalendarBundle implements Migration, ExtendExtensionAwareInterface
{
    use ExtendExtensionAwareTrait;
 
    public function up(Schema $schema, QueryBag $queries)
    {
        $table = $schema->getTable('oro_calendar_event_attendee');
        $this->extendExtension->addEnumField(
            $schema,
            $table,
            'status',
            'ce_attendee_status',
            false,
            false,
            [
                'extend' => ['owner' => ExtendScope::OWNER_CUSTOM]
            ]
         );
     }
```

*After:*

```php
    $queries->addPostQuery(
        new OutdatedInsertEnumValuesQuery(
            $this->outdatedExtendExtension, // Outdated extend extension must be used for old enums
            'cu_auth_status', 
            [new OutdatedEnumDataValue(CustomerUserAuthStatus::STATUS_EXPIRED, 'Expired', 3)]
        )
     );
```

```php
namespace Oro\Bundle\CalendarBundle\Migrations\Schema\v1_0;

class OroCalendarBundle implements Migration, OutdatedExtendExtensionAwareInterface
{
     use OutdatedExtendExtensionAwareTrait;
 
    public function up(Schema $schema, QueryBag $queries)
     {
         $table = $schema->getTable('oro_calendar_event_attendee');
        $this->outdatedExtendExtension->addOutdatedEnumField(
            $schema,
            $table,
            'status',
            'ce_attendee_status',
            false,
            false,
            [
                'extend' => ['owner' => ExtendScope::OWNER_CUSTOM],
                'enum' => [
                    'immutable_codes' => ExtendHelper::mapToEnumOptionIds('opportunity_type', ['new',]),
                ]
            ]
         );
     }
```

## Migration `immutable_codes` options:

*Before:*

```php
$options = new OroOptions();
    $options->set('enum', 'immutable_codes', [
        CustomerUserAuthStatus::STATUS_EXPIRED
    ]
);
```

*After:*

```php
$enumOptionIds = [
   ExtendHelper::buildEnumOptionId('cu_auth_status', CustomerUserAuthStatus::STATUS_EXPIRED)
];
$customerUserTable->addExtendColumnOption('auth_status', 'enum', 'immutable_codes', $enumOptionIds);
```

## Versioned schema migration (enum table name generation changes):

*Before:*

```php
$this->extendExtension->getNameGenerator()->generateEnumTableName('opportunity_status')
```

*After:*

```php
OutdatedExtendExtension::generateEnumTableName('opportunity_status')
```

## Migration data fixture:

*Before:*

```php
$queries->addPostQuery(new InsertEnumValuesQuery($this->extendExtension, 'cu_auth_status', [
    new EnumDataValue(CustomerUserAuthStatus::STATUS_EXPIRED, 'Expired', 3)
]));
```

*After:*

- All migration data that generates new enum options relies on language data. To ensure that this fixture executes correctly after adding a language, it is advisable to establish a dependency on it.

```php
class LoadLeadStatusOptionData extends AbstractEnumFixture
{
    protected function getData(): array
    {
        return [
            'new' => 'New',
            'qualified' => 'Qualified',
            'canceled' => 'Disqualified',
        ];
    }

    protected function getDefaultValue(): string
    {
        return 'new';
    }

    protected function getEnumCode(): string
    {
        return 'lead_status';
    }
}

```
- If the fixtures for data migration create enum options and do not extend from `AbstractEnumFixture`, add a dependency on `LoadLanguageData`. [[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

```php
class LoadLeadStatusOptionData extends AbstractFixture implements DependentFixtureInterface
{
    // fixture data migration methods ...
    
    #[\Override]
    public function getDependencies(): array // this dependency is required if your fixture is not extend `AbstractEnumFixture`
    {
        return [LoadLanguageData::class];
    }
}

```

## Joining enum options DQL:

*Before:*

- join Enum options via "relation"

```php
    ->leftJoin('attendee.status', 'attendee_status')
```

*After:*

```php
->leftJoin(
    EnumOption::class,
    'attendee_status',
    Expr\Join::WITH,
    "JSON_EXTRACT(attendee.serialized_data, 'status') = attendee_status"
)

```

- Query by enum fields

```php
$qb = $this->doctrine->getRepository(CustomerUser::class)
      ->createQueryBuilder('u')
      ->select('COUNT(u.id)')
      ->andWhere('IDENTITY(u.auth_status) <> :authStatus')
```

*After:*

```php
$qb = $this->doctrine->getRepository(CustomerUser::class)
      ->createQueryBuilder('u')
      ->select('COUNT(u.id)')
      ->andWhere("JSON_EXTRACT(u.serialized_data, 'auth_status') <> :authStatus")
```

- Multi-enum Join

```php
->addLeftJoin(
    $path,
    EnumOption::class,
    Join::WITH,
    QueryBuilderUtil::sprintf(
        "JSONB_ARRAY_CONTAINS_JSON(%s.serialized_data, '%s', CONCAT('\"', %s.id, '\"')) = true",
        $parentAlias,
        $fieldName,
        $alias
    )
)
```

- Multi-enum Query

```php
->andWhere(
    QueryBuilderUtil::sprintf(
        "JSONB_ARRAY_CONTAINS_JSON(e.serialized_data, '%s', '\"%s\"') = true",
        $fieldName,
        $optionId
    )
)
```

## Query to Enum Option Repository: [[p]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

- Class ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\Repository\EnumValueRepository``` was removed. 
Use ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\Repository\EnumOptionRepository``` instead.

- Use ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\Repository\EnumOptionRepository::createEnumOption``` 
instead of ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\Repository\EnumOptionRepository::createEnumValue```

*Before:*

```php
$statusEnum = $this->doctrine
    ->getRepository(ExtendHelper::buildEnumValueClassName(Attendee::STATUS_ENUM_CODE))
    ->find(Attendee::STATUS_NONE);
```

*After:*

```php
$statusEnum = $this->doctrine
     ->getRepository(EnumOption::class)
     ->find(ExtendHelper::buildEnumOptionId(Attendee::STATUS_ENUM_CODE, Attendee::STATUS_NONE)
);
```

- Use ```->findBy(...)``` instead of ```->findAll()``` while querying to Enum Option Repository

*Before:*

```php
    $internalStatuses = $this->doctrine
        ->getRepository(ExtendHelper::buildEnumValueClassName(Order::INTERNAL_STATUS_CODE))
        ->findAll();
```

*After:*

```php
    $internalStatuses = $this->doctrine
        ->getRepository(EnumOption::class)
        ->findBy(['enumCode' => Order::INTERNAL_STATUS_CODE]);
```

- Avoid usage of the name value as a search criteria argument for ```->findBy(...)``` and ```->findOneBy(...)``` method calls

*Before:*

```php
    $internalStatus = $this->doctrine
        ->getRepository(ExtendHelper::buildEnumValueClassName(Order::INTERNAL_STATUS_CODE))
        ->findOneBy(['name' => $name]);
```

*After:*

```php
    $internalStatus = $this->doctrine
        ->getRepository(EnumOption::class)
        ->findOneBy(['id' => ExtendHelper::buildEnumOptionId(Order::INTERNAL_STATUS_CODE, $name)]);
```

## Comparison of enum option: [[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

*Before:*

```php
  if ($user->getAuthStatus()->getId() !== UserManager::STATUS_ACTIVE) {}
```

```php
  if (!$originalValue instanceof AbstractEnumValue) {}
```

*After:*

```php
  if ($user->getAuthStatus()->getIntenalId() !== UserManager::STATUS_ACTIVE) {}
```

```php
  if (!$originalValue instanceof EnumOptionInterface) {}
```

## Getting of enum options:

- Class ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\EnumValueProvider``` was removed. 
Use ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\EnumOptionsProvider``` instead. [[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
- Use ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\EnumOptionsProvider::getEnumValueByCode()``` method
instead of ```Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\EnumValueProvider::getEnumValueByCode()``` [[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
- Service was renamed from ```oro_entity_extend.enum_value_provider``` to ```oro_entity_extend.enum_options_provider``` [[p]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

        name: 'D'
        enabled: true
        sortOrder: 1
        stopProcessing: true
        expression: "lineItems.any( lineItem.product.shipping_category.internalId = 'd' )" # use internalId instead of id
```

        columns:
            internal_status:
                label: oro.order.internal_status.label
```

### Data fixture changes:[[p]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

- load enum options

*Before:*

```yaml
Extend\Entity\EV_Acc_Internal_Rating:
    1_of_5:
        __construct:
            - '1_of_5'
            - '1_of_5'
```
*After:*

```yaml
Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\EnumOption:
    1_of_5:
        __construct:
            - 'acc_internal_rating' # enum_code
            - '1_of_5'
            - '1_of_5'
```

## Search index

- Enum fields do not change in the search index, the only thing you need to remember is that in the search, the internal id of the enum is used as a key, and the value remains unchanged.

## Import and Export

- The format of import and export has not changed, but you need to remember that the internalId of the enum option is used as an identifier.

### Transition definition configuration changes:

        || isset($changeSet['serialized_data'][0]['inventory_status'])) {}
```

### System configuration changes:

*Before:*

```php
    public function getConfigTreeBuilder(): TreeBuilder
    {
        $treeBuilder = new TreeBuilder('oro_seller_dashboard');
        $rootNode = $treeBuilder->getRootNode();

        SettingsBuilder::append(
            $rootNode,
            [
                'order_count_status_criteria' => [

            [
                'order_count_status_criteria' => [
                    'type' => 'array',
                    'value' => [
                        ExtendHelper::buildEnumOptionId(
                            Order::INTERNAL_STATUS_CODE,
                            OrderStatusesProviderInterface::INTERNAL_STATUS_OPEN
                        ),

  ...
```

### Removed

#### EntityBundle
* Removed **activity_support** configuration option from **dictionary** entity config scope. Consider replacing it with **collapsed_associations** configuration option of QueryDesignerBundle when it is used for your entity.

#### WsseAuthenticationBundle
* WsseAuthenticationBundle was removed. WSSE auth headers cannot be used for API. Use Oauth 2.0 instead.

## 6.0.0 (2024-03-30)
[Show detailed list of changes](incompatibilities-6-0.md)

### Security Changes

Based on symfony security changes, the approach to user authentication was updated. The main differences in the new approach will be described below.

* You should use `SecurityExtension::addAuthenticatorFactory()` instead of `SecurityExtension::addSecurityListenerFactory()`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

Before:

```php
$extension->addSecurityListenerFactory(new OrganizationFormLoginFactory());
```

After:

```php
$extension->addAuthenticatorFactory(new OrganizationFormLoginFactory());
```

* Authenticators have replaced the previous implementation of authentication using providers and listeners.

Before:

```text
Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Http\Firewal\OrganizationBasicAuthenticationListener
Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Authentication\Provider\UsernamePasswordOrganizationAuthenticationProvider
```

After:

```text
Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Authentication\Authenticator\UsernamePasswordOrganizationAuthenticator
```

* You should use `security.access_control` rules instead of anonymous authenticator.

Before:

```yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        healthcheck_http_status_checks:
            pattern:   /healthcheck/http_status_check(s$|/.*)
            provider:  chain_provider
            anonymous: true # anonymous authentication is not available
```

After:

```yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        healthcheck_http_status_checks:
            pattern:   /healthcheck/http_status_check(s$|/.*)
            provider:  chain_provider

oro_security:
    access_control:
        - { path: /healthcheck/http_status_check(s$|/.*), roles: PUBLIC_ACCESS }
```

* Changed implementation of `anonymous_customer_user` authnetication. To check whether the user is authorized, it is not enough to check whether the user is absent in the token, it is also worth checking whether this user is not a customer visitor (`CustomerVisitor::class`).[[p]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

Before:

```php
if ($this->getUser()) {
    # implementation
}
```

```php
if (null !== $this->getUser()) {
    # implementation
}
```

After:

```php
if ($this->getUser() instanceof AbstractUser) {
    # implementation
}
```

```php
if (!$this->getUser() instanceof CustomerUser) { 
    # implementation
}
```

* In twig templates, to check whether the user is authorized, you need to use the function `is_authenticated` that excludes from the check (anonymous customer user).

Before:

```text
{% if app.user is not null %}
    # implementation
{% endif %}
```

After:

```text
{% if is_authenticated() %}
    # implementation  
{% endif %}
```

* Added new `feature_firewall_authenticators` option to `api_firewalls` configuration to disable authenticator when some API feature is disabled.

Before:

```yaml
oro_api:
  api_firewalls:
    api_wsse_secured:
      feature_firewall_listeners:
        - Oro\Bundle\OAuth2ServerBundle\Security\Firewall\OAuth2Listener
    wsse_secured:
      feature_firewall_listeners:
        - Oro\Bundle\OAuth2ServerBundle\Security\Firewall\OAuth2Listener
    frontend_api_wsse_secured:
      feature_firewall_listeners:
        - Oro\Bundle\OAuth2ServerBundle\Security\Firewall\OAuth2Listener
```

After:

```yaml
oro_api:
  api_firewalls:
    api_wsse_secured:
      feature_firewall_authenticators: # FeatureDependAuthenticatorChecker
        - Oro\Bundle\OAuth2ServerBundle\Security\Authenticator\OAuth2Authenticator
    wsse_secured:
      feature_firewall_authenticators: # FeatureDependAuthenticatorChecker
        - Oro\Bundle\OAuth2ServerBundle\Security\Authenticator\OAuth2Authenticator
    frontend_api_wsse_secured:
      feature_firewall_authenticators: # FeatureDependAuthenticatorChecker
        - Oro\Bundle\OAuth2ServerBundle\Security\Authenticator\OAuth2Authenticator
```

### Added

#### ApiBundle
* String value(s) contains only space symbols is not allowed for string API filters. For example the following filters
  are not valid: `filter[code]= `, `filter[code]=code1, ,code2`. If by some reasons you want to allow value(s) contains
  only space symbols for some filters, you can use `allow_empty` filter option in `Resources/config/oro/api.yml`, e.g.:

```yaml
api:
  entities:
    Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\SomeEntity:
      filters:
        code:
          options:
            allow_empty: true
```
* Added the ability to specify `\Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\GroupSequence` in validation groups of API config via nested arrays.

#### FormBundle
* Added the chain of constraint converters to `\Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Form\Extension\JsValidation\ConstraintConverter` with basic implementation in `\Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Form\Extension\JsValidation\GenericConstraintConverter`.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Form\Extension\JsValidation\RangeConstraintConverter` for `Range` constraint with the ability to handle `minPropertyPath` and `maxPropertyPath`.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Validator\Constraints\AdaptivelyValidCollection` validation constraint for validating a collection of entities with different validation groups for the new, updated and unchanged elements.

#### PlatformBundle
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\PlatformBundle\Validator\Constraints\ValidEmbeddable` that allows to apply `Valid` constraint with explicit validation groups specified in `embeddedGroups` option.

#### EmailBundle
* Added the email template inheritance feature that provides an ability to extend an email template from parent one.
* Added `oro_email.email_template_wysiwyg_enabled` system config setting allowing to toggle WYSIWYG an Email Template create/edit page. Now WYSIWYG is turned off by default. It is not recommended to turn it on if you are using the email template inheritance feature as it may break template syntax.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Provider\RenderedEmailTemplateProvider` as an entry point to get a rendered email template by criteria.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Sender\EmailTemplateSender` as an entry point to render email template and send it to recipients.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Factory\EmailModelFromEmailTemplateFactory` as an entry point to render an email template and create an email model ready to be sent.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Provider\EmailTemplateContextProvider` that dispatches `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Event\EmailTemplateContextCollectEvent` to collect email template context (e.g. localization) needed for its searching and rendering.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Controller\AjaxEmailController::compileEmailAction` to use it for email template rendering instead of `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Controller\Api\Rest\EmailTemplateController::getCompiledAction` in a Compose Email dialog.

#### EntityBundle
* Added method `getEntityTreeNodeByPropertyPath` to JS `EntityStructureDataProvider` (see [documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/bundles/platform/EntityBundle/entity-structure-data-provider#get-entitytreenode-by-property-path))
* Added magic property `entityTree` to `EntityStructureDataProvider` (see [documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/bundles/platform/EntityBundle/entity-structure-data-provider#entity-tree)) that allows walk through entity fields tree
* Added JS `EntityTreeNode` that is used in `EntityStructureDataProvider`

#### FormBundle
* Added JS `ExpressionEditorComponent` (see [documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/bundles/platform/FormBundle/expression-editor#expressioneditorcomponent) that used instead regular `ViewComponent` in formtype options of rule editor. It's designed to prepare instance of `EntityStructureDataProvider` and create instance of `ExpressionEditorView`
  expression-editor-component.js
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Validator\Constraints\UniqueEntity` validation constraint and validator.

#### UIBundle
* Added `renderCollapsibleWysiwygContentPreview` and `renderWysiwygContentPreview` TWIG macros to UIBundle for
  rendering WYSIWYG content in backoffice.

#### CurrencyBundle
* Added supporting of the `readonly` attribute in `\Oro\Bundle\CurrencyBundle\Form\Type\PriceType`.

### Changed

#### ApiBundle
* Removed support of `{@feature}` placeholder in API documentation. It was done because API documentation should not
  depend on the application configuration changes made by users.

#### EmailBundle
* Decomposed `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Provider\EmailRenderer`, made it as an entry point to render an email template.
  * Added `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Event\EmailTemplateRenderBeforeEvent` and `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Event\EmailTemplateRenderAfterEvent`
* Decomposed `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Form\Type\EmailType` into `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Form\EventListener\EmailTemplateRenderingSubscriber` to move the email template rendering responsibility to the form subscriber.
* Changed `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Migrations\Data\ORM\AbstractEmailFixture` to make it ensure that an email template name is equal to its file name.

#### EntityBundle
* Refactored JS `EntityStructureDataProvider` [[?]](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/EntityBundle/Resources/public/js/app/services/entity-structure-data-provider.js) (see [documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/bundles/platform/EntityBundle/entity-structure-data-provider/))
  - method `getPropertyPathByPath` renamed to `getRelativePropertyPathByPath`
  - method `getPathByPropertyPath` renamed to `getPathByRelativePropertyPath`
  - method `getPathByPropertyPathSafely` renamed to `getPathByRelativePropertyPathSafely`
* Decomposed `\Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Twig\Sandbox\TemplateRenderer` into separate processors and factories. Moved the TWIG sandbox configuration out of its responsibility.

#### FormBundle
* Refactored `ExpressionEditorView` [[?]](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Bundle/FormBundle/Resources/public/js/app/views/expression-editor-view.js) (see [documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/bundles/platform/FormBundle/expression-editor/#expressioneditorview))
* Refactored `ExpressionEditorUtil` [[?]](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/FormBundle/Resources/public/js/expression-editor-util.js) (see [documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/bundles/platform/FormBundle/expression-editor/#expressioneditorutil))
  * made it descendant of `BaseClass`
  * changed options format

#### LocaleBundle
* Updated `\Oro\Bundle\LocaleBundle\Provider\CurrentLocalizationProvider::setCurrentLocalization` to make it additionally switch localization, language, locale in `\Locale`, `\Gedmo\Translatable\TranslatableListener` and Symfony translator.

#### QueryDesignerBundle
* JS `*-filter-initialized` modules, defined over `init_module` option in filter configuration, now expected to export a sync callback function

### Datagrids
* All datagrids used in storefront application were moved from `<BundleName>/Resources/config/oro/datagrids.yml` to layouts folder of the `default` theme `<BundleName>/Resources/views/layouts/default/config/datagrids.yml`.
This means that storefront datagrids can now differ between themes. Any storefront grid customization should also be moved to the theme folder.

#### SearchBundle
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\Event\BeforeIndexEntitiesEvent` that is dispatched in `\Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\EventListener\IndexListener` in postFlush method after changing or updating indexing entities.

#### DataGridBundle
* Added postponed delete entities logic to `\Oro\Bundle\DataGridBundle\Extension\MassAction\DeleteMassActionHandler`.

#### UIBundle

* Removed unused `\Oro\Bundle\NotificationBundle\Model\EmailTemplate`, use instead `\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Model\EmailTemplate`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

## 5.1.0 (2023-03-31)

[Show detailed list of changes](incompatibilities-5-1.md)

### Migration of Extended Entities

To remove the code generation in runtime, OroPlatform now uses extendable implementation of magic __get, __set and __call methods.

To migrate your entities, follow the steps below:[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

1. Add `ExtendEntityInterface` implementation for extendable entity.
2. Add the usage of `ExtendEntityTrait` for extendable entity.
3. Remove the extended entity as a layer, moving the base extend classes to the main extendable entity.

Before:

```php
/**
 * Extendable User entity.
 */
class User extends ExtendUser implements
    EmailOwnerInterface,
    EmailHolderInterface,
    FullNameInterface,
    AdvancedApiUserInterface
{
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace Oro\Bundle\UserBundle\Model;

use Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Entity\AbstractEnumValue;
use Oro\Bundle\UserBundle\Entity\AbstractUser;

/**
 * This class is required to make User entity extendable.
 *
 * @method setAuthStatus(AbstractEnumValue $enum)
 * @method AbstractEnumValue getAuthStatus()
 */
abstract class ExtendUser extends AbstractUser
{
    /**
     * Constructor
     *
     * The real implementation of this method is auto generated.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: If the derived class has own constructor it must call parent constructor.
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
```

After:

```php
/**
 * Extendable User entity.
 * 
 * @method setAuthStatus(AbstractEnumValue $enum)
 * @method AbstractEnumValue getAuthStatus()
 */
class User extends AbstractUser implements
    EmailOwnerInterface,
    EmailHolderInterface,
    FullNameInterface,
    AdvancedApiUserInterface,
    ExtendEntityInterface
{
    use ExtendEntityTrait;  // The implementation of the ExtendEntityInterface 
}
```

#### Accessing Extended Properties and Methods[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

* To access the properties and methods of all entities, you must use the PropertyAccess factory methods.
* Method PropertyAccess::createPropertyAccessor() - used to create base symfony property accessor with custom reflection extractor. 
* Method PropertyAccess::createPropertyAccessorWithDotSyntax() - should be used instead of Oro\Component\PropertyAccess\PropertyAccessor.

Before:

```php
   protected function getPropertyAccessor(): PropertyAccessorInterface
   {
       if (!$this->propertyAccessor) {
           $this->propertyAccessor = new PropertyAccessor();
       }
       return $this->propertyAccessor;
   }
```

After:

```php
   protected function getPropertyAccessor(): PropertyAccessorInterface
   {
       if (!$this->propertyAccessor) {
           $this->propertyAccessor = PropertyAccess::createPropertyAccessor(); 
           // or PropertyAccess::createPropertyAccessorWithDotSyntax()
       }
       return $this->propertyAccessor;
   }
```

OR:

```yaml
services:
  acme_test.factory.test_factory:
    class: Acme\Bundle\TestBundle\Factory\TestFactory
    arguments:
      - '@property_accessor' // or '@oro_entity_extend.accessor.property_accessor_with_dot_array_syntax' instead of Oro PropertyAccessor
```

#### Extended Entity Helper

* For extended entities, we should use the helper method to check if extended property or method exists.
* Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\EntityPropertyInfo helper methods must be used instead of property_exists() or method_exists() native methods for extended entities.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

**Important:** : property_exists() or method_exists() native methods are not working with extended entities.

Before:

```php
    if(property_exists($extendedEntity, 'extendPropertyName')) {
    }

    if(method_exists($extendedEntity, 'getExtendMethodName')) {
    }
```

After:

```php
    if(EntityPropertyInfo::propertyExists($extendedEntity, 'extendPropertyName')) {
    }

    if(EntityPropertyInfo::methodExists($extendedEntity, 'getExtendMethodName')) {
    }
```

#### Reflection Usage With Extended Entities[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

* For extended entities, use Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\EntityReflectionClass instead of \ReflectionClass;
* For extended properties, use Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Doctrine\Persistence\Reflection\ReflectionVirtualProperty
* For extended methods, use Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Doctrine\Persistence\Reflection\VirtualReflectionMethod

Before:

```php
   $reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass($className);
   $reflectionProperty = new ReflectionProperty($className, 'extendProperty')
   $reflectionProperty = new ReflectionMethod($className, 'getExtendPropertyMethod')
```

After:

```php
    $reflectionClass = new EntityReflectionClass($entity);
    $reflectionProperty = ReflectionVirtualProperty::create($extendPropertyName);
    $reflectionMethod = VirtualReflectionMethod::create($objectOrClass, $extendedMethodName);
```

#### Entity Generators

Instead of entity generators, implement ``Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\EntityExtend\EntityFieldExtensionInterface``, that allows extending magic methods behavior in runtime.

#### Clone Extend Entity

To copy all the values of the extend entity (together with the virtual fields), call the
``ExtendEntityTrait->cloneExtendEntityStorage()`` method

#### Activity

Entities need to be extended manually, before ActivityInterface and ExtendActivity (trait) are added at the code
generation stage in the new implementation. 

Before:

```php
class Call extends ExtendCall implements DatesAwareInterface
{
}
```

After:

```php
class Call implements DatesAwareInterface, ActivityInterface, ExtendEntityInterface
{
use ExtendActivity;
use ExtendEntityTrait;
}
```

### Added

#### AttachmentBundle
* Added `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Provider\OriginalFileNameProvider` filename provider that
  uses a sanitized original filename for files if `attachment_original_filenames` feature is enabled.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Entity\File::$externalUrl` property to store external file URL.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Provider\ExternalUrlProvider` (`oro_attachment.provider.external_url_provider`) that
  returns `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Entity\File::$externalUrl` for a file, a resized or a filtered image URL.
* Added `oro_attachment.provider.external_url_provider` to the decorators chain of the file url providers
  `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Provider\FileUrlProviderInterface` (`oro_attachment.provider.file_url`).
* Added `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Model\ExternalFile` model as a descendant of `\SplFileInfo` that represents
  an externally stored file.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Tools\ExternalFileFactory` that creates `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Model\ExternalFile`
  from a URL or `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Entity\File` entity.
* Added `isExternalFile` form option to `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Form\Type\FileType` that enables the external file URL
  input instead of the upload input.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFormTypeProvider` that provides form type and common form options
  for extend fields.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFormOptionsProvider` (`oro_entity_extend.provider.extend_field_form_options`)
  that collects extend field form options from the underlying providers
  of `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFormOptionsProviderInterface` interface.
* Added service container tag `oro_entity_extend.form_options_provider` for extend field form options providers to be used
  in `oro_entity_extend.provider.extend_field_form_options`.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFileFormOptionsProvider` that provides form options for
  `file`, `image`, `multiFile`, `multiImage` types of extend fields.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Validator\Constraints\RegExpSyntax` validation constraint for checking regular expression
  syntax.
* Added `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\ImportExport\FileManipulator` that uploads a file or clones it from the existing
  one during import.
  
#### DigitalAssetBundle
* Added `Oro\Bundle\DigitalAssetBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFileDamFormOptionsProvider` that manages `dam_widget_enabled`
  form option based on `use_dam`, `is_stored_externally` entity field config values for `file`, `image`,
  `multiFile`, `multiImage` types of extend fields.
  
#### ImportExportBundle
* Added `markAsSkipped` and `isFieldSkipped` method to `\Oro\Bundle\ImportExportBundle\Event\DenormalizeEntityEvent`
  to mark certain field as skipped during denormalization process to avoid possible type conflicts.
  
#### LocaleBundle
* Added entity name provider for `Locale` entity
* Added `oro:localization:localized-fallback-values:cleanup-unused` command that finds and deletes orphaned
  `Oro\Bundle\LocaleBundle\Entity\LocalizedFallbackValue` entities that could appear due to disabled `orphanRemoval` option.
* Added `cloneLocalizedFallbackValueAssociations()` method that is generated automatically and should be used in
  `__clone()` for entities with localized fallback value relations to ensure correct cloning of localized fallback value
  collections.
*  Added `\Oro\Bundle\LocaleBundle\Cache\Normalizer\LocalizedFallbackValueCollectionNormalizer` and `\Oro\Bundle\LocaleBundle\Cache\Normalizer\LocalizedFallbackValueNormalizer` for using when caching complex structures

#### MigrationBundle
* For better data consistency and more valid testing scenarios, data fixtures are now validated during ORM demo data load, and Behat fixtures load.

#### SearchBundle
* Search query aggregations now can have parameters added via fourth parameter of the `addAggregate` method
* Added possibility to set maximum number of results for the count search aggregation

#### TestFrameworkBundle

* Marked all the tests that depend on behat_test environment with the ``@behat-test-env`` tag.
* Replaced message queue Behat isolators with the JobStatusSubscriber that checks the jobs table and does not depend on application changes
* Added the `--do-not-run-consumer` argument to the bin/behat command to run application tests in the production-like environment where the supervisord or systemd runs the consumer.
* Added maintenance mode isolators to toggle the maintenance mode when the database is backed up and restored so the message consumer does not produce errors during these operations.
* Updated some behat tests and contexts to work with the new isolators.

#### UIBundle
* Added `renderCollapsibleWysiwygContentPreview` and `renderWysiwygContentPreview` TWIG macros to UIBundle for
  rendering WYSIWYG content in backoffice.

* Added `oroui/js/app/modules/swipeable-module` instead of `swipeableView` to
  dispatch Custom Swipe Events to a document.
  The provided Swipe Events are:
  - The `swipestart` event is fired when one or more touch points are placed on the touch surface;
  - The `swipemove` event is fired when one or more touch points are moved along the touch surface
    with the detail option that includes the `x` and `y` coordinates of the pointer;
  - The `swipeend` event fires when one or more touch points are removed from the touch surface
    with the detail option that includes the `x` and `y` coordinates and `direction` of the pointer;
  - The `swipeleft` and `swiperight` events are fired when one or more touch points are moved along the touch surface
    with the detail option that includes the `x` and `y` coordinates of the pointer.
    It is fired only if the elapsed time between the start and end events is less than or equal to `maxAllowedTime`;

#### LayoutBundle
* Added `\Oro\Component\Layout\Extension\Theme\Model\ThemeManager::getThemesHierarchy` to easily get the theme hierarchy for the specified theme.
* Added the ability to specify response status code via layout context option `response_status_code`.

#### Layout Component

#### NavigationBundle
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\NavigationBundle\Entity\MenuUpdateInterface::isSynthetic` to distinguish menu updates applied to the system menu items even if they do not exist anymore.
* Added "synthetic" field to `\Oro\Bundle\NavigationBundle\Entity\MenuUpdate`.
* Added `\Oro\Bundle\NavigationBundle\Event\MenuUpdatesApplyAfterEvent` that is dispatched in `\Oro\Bundle\NavigationBundle\Menu\MenuUpdateBuilder` after all menu updates are applied.

* Added `\Oro\Bundle\NavigationBundle\Utils\MenuUpdateUtils::createRecursiveIterator`, `\Oro\Bundle\NavigationBundle\Utils\MenuUpdateUtils::flattenMenuItem` for more convenient access to the menu item.

### Changed

* Updated from `slick-carousel: 1.7.1` to fork `@oroinc/slick-carousel: 1.7.1-oro1` with patched internal `postSlide` method
* Updated path of styles from `~slick-carousel/slick/slick.scss` to `~@oroinc/slick-carousel/slick/slick.scss`
  and path of js from `slick-carousel/slick/slick` to `@oroinc/slick-carousel/slick/slick`

#### TestUtils component
* Moved all ORM relates mocks and test cases to `Testing` component.
  Old namespace for these classes was `Oro\Component\TestUtils\ORM`.
  New namespace is `Oro\Component\Testing\Unit\ORM`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

#### ApiBundle
* The parameter `throwException` was removed from the method `convertToEntityType`
  of `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Util\ValueNormalizerUtil`. Use the `tryConvertToEntityType` method
  when an entity type might not exist.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
* The parameter `throwException` was removed from the method `convertToEntityClass`
  of `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Util\ValueNormalizerUtil`. Use the `tryConvertToEntityClass` method
  when an entity class might not exist.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
  
#### AssetBundle
* Changed configuration option `disable_babel` (`true` by default) to `with_babel` (`false` by default).

#### AttachmentBundle
* Changed `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Entity\File::$file` property type to `?\SplFileInfo`
  to allow `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Model\ExternalFile`. Methods `setFile` and `getFile` are changed correspondingly.[[p]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
* Changed `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Manager\FileManager::getFileFromFileEntity` return type to `?\SplFileInfo`
  to comply with `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\Entity\File::$file` property type.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
* Changed `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\ImportExport\FileImportStrategyHelper::getFieldLabel` visibility to public,
  so it can be used for getting human-readable field names during import.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
* Changed `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\ImportExport\EventListener\FileStrategyEventListener` constructor, so it expects
  `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\ImportExport\FileManipulator $fileManipulator`
  instead of `$fileManager`, also the `$authorizationChecker` argument is removed.

### CacheBundle

* The `oro.cache.abstract` abstract service is removed, use `oro.data.cache` instead, with the `cache.pool` tag 
and the namespace in a tag attribute.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

  Before: 
  ```yaml
  services:
      oro_catalog.layout.data_provider.category.cache:
          parent: oro.cache.abstract
          public: false
          calls:
              - [ setNamespace, [ 'oro_catalog_category' ] ]
  ```
  After:
  ```yaml
  services:
      oro_catalog.layout.data_provider.category.cache:
          parent: oro.data.cache
          public: false
          tags:
              - { name: 'cache.pool', namespace: 'oro_catalog_category' }
  ```

#### DataGridBundle
* The `iconHideText` option for `action-launcher` and `dropdown-select-choice-launcher` views was removed, use the `launcherMode` option instead.
  The `launcherMode` option can have three different values:
    - `icon-text` - shows datagrid actions with icons and text labels;
    - `icon-only` - shows datagrid actions as icons;
    - `text-only`- shows datagrid actions as text labels;
    
#### DigitalAssetBundle
* Changed `Oro\Bundle\DigitalAssetBundle\ImportExport\EventListener\DigitalAssetAwareFileStrategyEventListener` constructor,
  so it expects `Oro\Bundle\AttachmentBundle\ImportExport\FileImportStrategyHelper $fileImportStrategyHelper`
  instead of `$doctrineHelper`.

#### EntityExtendBundle
* Changed `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Form\Guesser\ExtendFieldTypeGuesser` constructor, so it expects
  `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFormTypeProvider $extendFieldFormTypeProvider` and
  `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFormOptionsProviderInterface $extendFieldFormOptionsProvider`
  instead of `$enumConfigProvider`.
* Changed `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Form\Guesser\ExtendFieldTypeGuesser` so it gets the form type from
  `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFormTypeProvider` and the form options from
  `Oro\Bundle\EntityExtendBundle\Provider\ExtendFieldFormOptionsProvider` now.

#### OrganizationBundle
* Changed the `cascade` Doctrine option of the `\Oro\Bundle\OrganizationBundle\Entity\Ownership\BusinessUnitAwareTrait::$owner`
  association: it is not cascade-persisted anymore.

#### PlatformBundle
* As the 'composer/composer' package is no longer used, the `Oro\Bundle\PlatformBundle\Provider\PackageProvider` class based services now provide the packages info in pure arrays instead of the array of the `Composer\Package\PackageInterface` interface based objects. The returned array structure is as follows: `['package_name' => ['pretty_version' => '1.0.0', 'license' => ['MIT']]]`..

#### ReminderBundle
* Reminder template messages are added as JS template macros under `reminderTemplates` namespace. Twig placeholder `oro_reminder_reminder_templates` no longer in use. 
  
#### SearchBundle
* Changed search engine configuration: `search_engine_dsn` parameter is used instead of `search_engine_name`, `search_engine_host`, `search_engine_port`, `search_engine_index_prefix`, `search_engine_username`, `search_engine_password`, `search_engine_ssl_verification`, `search_engine_ssl_cert`,  `search_engine_ssl_cert_password`, `search_engine_ssl_key`, `search_engine_ssl_key_password`.
* Entity title in the search index is no longer stored in the special field in the DB, now it is stored as a regular index text field called `system_entity_name`
* Entity title is no longer returned in the search results by default, now it has to be manually added to the select section of the query
* All entities presented in the search index now have proper entity name providers

#### RedisConfigBundle
* Added the bundle itself to `oro/platform` package. The bundle came from outer package `oro/redis-config` and it was rebuilt to utilize Symfony redis configuration components instead of once from 3rd party package `snc/redis-bundle`.

#### UIBundle
* `oroui/js/app/components/viewport-component` has been changed options from `viewport: {maxScreenType: 'tablet'}` or `viewport: {minScreenType: 'tablet'}` to `viewport: 'tablet'`
- As a result, you need to update your `html`:

  **view.twig**
    ```diff
      {% block _main_menu_container_widget %}
        {% set attr =  layout_attr_defaults(attr, {
          '~class': ' main-menu-outer',
          'data-page-component-module': 'oroui/js/app/components/viewport-component',
          'data-page-component-options': {
    -         viewport: {
    -             maxScreenType: 'tablet',
    -         },
              component: 'oroui/js/app/components/view-component',
              view: 'orocommercemenu/js/app/widgets/menu-traveling-widget'
          },
    ```
    ```diff
      {% block _main_menu_container_widget %}
        {% set attr =  layout_attr_defaults(attr, {
          '~class': ' main-menu-outer',
          'data-page-component-module': 'oroui/js/app/components/viewport-component',
          'data-page-component-options': {
    +         viewport: 'tablet',
              component: 'oroui/js/app/components/view-component',
              view: 'orocommercemenu/js/app/widgets/menu-traveling-widget'
          },
    ```
* `oroui/js/viewport-manager` has been update `isApplicable` method. From now on, the method accepts, as arguments, a string or an array of strings of media types.
- For example:
  + `viewportManager.isApplicable('tablet')`
  + `viewportManager.isApplicable('tablet', 'tablet-small')`
  + `viewportManager.isApplicable(['tablet', 'tablet-small'])`
- Added next public methods:
  + `getBreakpoints(context)`: returns object with all registered breakpoints from css property `--breakpoints`. It is possible to pass the `context` of the document as an argument.
  + `getMediaType(mediaType)`: returns `MediaQueryList` by `mediaType` argument.
- Removed next public methods:
  + `getViewport`
  + `getScreenType`
  + `getAllowScreenTypes`

The widgets `collapse-widget`, `collapse-group-widget`, `rows-collapse-widget` were removed, use the `bootstrap-collapse` instead.
- As a result, you need to update your `html`:

  **view.twig**
    ```diff
    - {% set collapseView = {
    -   storageKey: 'unique storage key',
    -   uid: 'unique storage key id',
    -   animationSpeed: 0,
    -   closeClass: 'overflows',
    -   forcedState: false,
    -   checkOverflow: false,
    -   open: false,

## 5.0.0 (2022-01-26)
[Show detailed list of changes](incompatibilities-5-0.md)

### Added

* Added support for Right To Left UI design; see more in the [Right to Left UI Support](https://doc.oroinc.com/frontend/rtl-support/) topic. 

#### ApiBundle
* From now the `event` tag attribute for `customize_form_data` action API processor services is mandatory.
  This was made to prevent potential logical errors.
* `pre_flush_data`, `post_flush_data` and `post_save_data` events were added to the `customize_form_data` action.
  The `pre_flush_data` and `post_flush_data` events are dispatched together with the `flush()` method of
  the entity manager in the same database transaction.
  The `post_save_data` event is dispatched after the database transaction is committed.
  API processors for these events can be used to customize database update logic.

#### UIBundle

Third party dependencies such as [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) where forked.
  - As a result, you need to update your `scss` and configuration files:

    **assets.yml**
   
      ```diff
      # ...
          inputs:
      -        - '~bootstrap/scss/nav'
      +        - '~@oroinc/bootstrap/scss/nav'
      ```
    **\*.scss**
      ```diff     
    
      - @import "~bootstrap/scss/variables";
      + @import "~@oroinc/bootstrap/scss/variables";
      ```

    **jsmodules.yml**
      ```diff
      # ...
      - bootstrap-alert$: bootstrap/js/dist/alert
      + bootstrap-alert$: '@oroinc/bootstrap/js/dist/alert'
      ```
      
      
## 4.2.2

## 4.2.0 (2020-01-29)
[Show detailed list of changes](incompatibilities-4-2.md)

### Added

#### ApiBundle
* Implemented support of the `inherit_data` form option for the `nestedObject` data type. It allows to configure
  nested objects even if an entity does not have a setter method for it.
  
#### LayoutBundle
* Added `is_xml_http_request` option to the Layout context which lets you know if the current request is an ajax request.
* Added two new options `onLoadingCssClass` and `disableControls` to the `layout_subtree_update` block configuration.

#### MessageQueueBundle
* Added a possibility to filter messages before they are sent to the message queue.
  See [Filtering Messages in the Message Producer](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/mq/filtering-messages/).
  
#### SecurityBundle
* Added `generate_uuid` action. The action generates UUID and puts the value to the specified attribute.

#### TranslationBundle
* Added migration query `Oro\Bundle\TranslationBundle\Migration\DeleteTranslationsByDomainAndKeyPrefixQuery` that can be used to remove unused translations by domain and key prefix.

#### WorkflowBundle
* Added migration query `Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Migration\RemoveWorkflowAwareEntitiesQuery` that can be used to remove instances of entity created from the specified workflow.
* Added method `Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Model\WorkflowManager::transitUnconditionally()`. The method transits a workflow item without checking for preconditions and conditions.

### Changed

* The service `oro_attachment.manager.media_cache_manager_registry` was renamed to `oro_attachment.media_cache_manager_registry`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
* The service `oro_attachment.provider.attachment_file_name_provider` was renamed to `oro_attachment.provider.file_name`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

#### DataGridBundle

#### EntityBundle
* The service `oro_entity.virtual_field_provider.chain` was renamed to `oro_entity.virtual_field_provider`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
* The service `oro_entity.virtual_relation_provider.chain` was renamed to `oro_entity.virtual_relation_provider`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

#### FormBundle
* Upgraded TinyMCE library to version 5.6.0, see [migration guide](https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/how-to-migrate-from-tinymce-4-to-tinymce-5/)
  * Removed the `bdesk_photo` plugin, use the standard `image` plugin and the toolbar button instead.
  * Major UX changes:
    * the default skin of editor 5.6.0
    * popups "add link" and "add image" are not oro-themed
    * fullscreen mode is actual full screen, without the page container limit like previously
    * changed UX for adding embedded image
  * Minor UX changes:
    * editor's width is 100% by default
    * status bar is turned on by default (to allow to resize the editor vertically)
    * the element path is mostly turned off by default. It is turned on only in places where the status bar was enabled before

#### NotificationBundle

* `Oro\Bundle\NotificationBundle\Entity\Event` and
  `Oro\Bundle\NotificationBundle\DependencyInjection\Compiler\RegisterNotificationEventsCompilerPass` classes were deleted.

  To migrate custom notification events, delete all the usages of `Event` and `RegisterNotificationEventsCompilerPass` classes
  and register events with the YAML configuration according to [the documentation](http://doc.oroinc.com/master/backend/bundles/platform/NotificationBundle/notification-event/).
  
#### PlatformBundle
* The handling of `priority` attribute for `oro_platform.console.global_options_provider` DIC tag
  was changed to correspond Symfony recommendations.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
  If you have services with this tag, change the sign of the priority value for them.
  E.g. `{ name: oro_platform.console.global_options_provider, priority: 100 }` should be changed to
  `{ name: oro_platform.console.global_options_provider, priority: -100 }`

#### QueryDesignerBundle
* The class `Oro\Bundle\QueryDesignerBundle\QueryDesigner\AbstractQueryConverter` was refactored to decrease its complexity.
  The state of all query converters was moved to "context" classes.
  The base context class is `Oro\Bundle\QueryDesignerBundle\QueryDesigner\QueryConverterContext`.
  If you have own query converters, update them according to new architecture.
* The class `Oro\Bundle\QueryDesignerBundle\QueryDesigner\FilterProcessor` was renamed to `Oro\Bundle\SegmentBundle\Query\FilterProcessor`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
* The service `oro_query_designer.query_designer.filter_processor` was renamed to `oro_segment.query.filter_processor`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

#### SecurityBundle
* The handling of `priority` attribute for `oro.security.filter.acl_privilege` DIC tag
  was changed to correspond Symfony recommendations.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
  If you have services with this tag, change the sign of the priority value for them.
  E.g. `{ name: oro.security.filter.acl_privilege, priority: 100 }` should be changed to
  `{ name: oro.security.filter.acl_privilege, priority: -100 }`

#### ScopeBundle
* TRIGGER database privilege became required

#### SSOBundle
* The configuration option `oro_sso.enable_google_sso` was renamed to `oro_google_integration.enable_sso`.
* The configuration option `oro_sso.domains` was renamed to `oro_google_integration.sso_domains`.
* The service `oro_sso.oauth_provider` was renamed to `oro_sso.oauth_user_provider`.[[f]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)

#### UserBundle
* The name for `/api/authstatuses` REST API resource was changed to `/api/userauthstatuses`.
* The following changes were done in the `Oro\Bundle\UserBundle\Provider\RolePrivilegeCategoryProvider` class:[[p]](#upgrade-toolkit-coverage)
  - the method `getPermissionCategories` was renamed to `getCategories`
  - the method `getTabList` was renamed to `getTabIds`
  - the following methods were removed `getAllCategories`, `getTabbedCategories`, `getCategory`,
    `addProvider`, `getProviders`, `getProviderByName`, `hasProvider`

#### UIBundle
* Modules of `jquery-ui` library are now declared separately, and each of them has to be imported directly, if necessary (`jquery-ui/widget`, `jquery-ui/widgets/sortable` etc.)
* Moved layout themes build artefacts from `public/layout-build/{theme}` to `public/build/{theme}` folder.
* Moved admin theme build artefacts from `public/build` to `public/build/admin` folder.
* Changed the output path for the admin theme from `css/oro/oro.css` to `css/oro.css`.
* Changed the output path for tinymce CSS entry points from `css/tinymce/*` to `to tinymce/*`.

#### webpack-config-builder

* All the JavaScript dev-dependencies, including webpack, karma, and eslint, are now managed on the application level. As a result, there is no need to install node modules in the `vendor/oro/platform/build` folder anymore. Now the application has only one node_modules folder - in the root directory. This allows application developers to take full control of the dev-dependencies in the project.
* The `webpack-config-builder` module was moved to a separate package and now is published at npmjs.com as `oro-webpack-config-builder` package.
  The package provides an integration of OroPlatform based applications with the Webpack.
* The `public/bundles/npmassets` folder was deleted. This folder contained the full copy of the node_modules folder,
  which is unnecessary with the webpack build. Now you have to reference node modules directly by their names.
  - To migrate the scss code and configuration, replace the `npmassets/` and `bundles/nmpassets` prefixes with `~` for all the node modules paths:

    **assets.yml**
    ```diff
    # ...
        inputs:
    -        - 'bundles/npmassets/slick-carousel/slick/slick.scss'
    +        - '~slick-carousel/slick/slick.scss'
    ```
    **\*.scss**
    ```diff     
     
    - @import "npmassets/bootstrap/scss/variables";
    + @import "~bootstrap/scss/variables";
    
    - @import "bundles/npmassets/bootstrap/scss/variables";
    + @import "~bootstrap/scss/variables";
    ```
  - To migrate the javascript code and configuration, drop `npmassets/` and `bundles/nmpassets` prefixes from the node module path.

    **jsmodules.yml**
    ```diff
    # ...
    - slick$: npmassets/slick-carousel/slick/slick
    + slick$: slick-carousel/slick/slick
    ```
    **\*.js**
    ```diff
    # ... 
    - import 'npmassets/focus-visible/dist/focus-visible';
    + import 'focus-visible/dist/focus-visible';
    # ...
    - require('bundles/npmassets/Base64/base64');
    + require('Base64/base64');
    ```
* To make an NPM library assets publicly available (e.g. some plugins of a library are have to be loaded dynamically in runtime) you can define in your module that an utilized library requires context:
  ```js
  require.context(
    '!file-loader?name=[path][name].[ext]]&outputPath=../_static/&context=tinymce!tinymce/plugins',
    true,
    /.*/
  );
  ```
  This way Webpack will copy `tinymce/plugins` folder into public directory `public/build/_static/_/node_modules/tinymce/plugins`.

  Pay attention for the leading exclamation point, it says that all other loaders (e.g. css-loader) should be ignored for this context.
  If you nevertheless need to process all included css files by Webpack -- leading `!` has to be removed.
* The "oomphinc/composer-installers-extender" composer package was removed. As a result, composer components are not copied automatically to the `public/bundles/components` directory.
  To copy files that are not handled by webpack automatically to the public folder, you can use approach with `require.context` described above.
* The "resolve-url-loader" NPM dependency was removed. Now you should always specify the valid relative or absolute path in SCSS files explicitly. The absolute path must start with `~`:
    ```diff
    # ... 
    # The relative path works the same. You only might need to fix typos, 
    # as the resolve-url-loader ignored them because of the magic global search feature.
    background-image: url(../../img/glyphicons-halflings.png);
    # ...
    # The path without `~` is a relative path
    $icomoon-font-path: "fonts" !default;
    # ... 
    # An absolute path should be prefixed with `~`
    - $icomoon-font-path: "fonts" !default;
    + $icomoon-font-path: "~bundles/orocms/fonts/grapsejs/fonts" !default;
    ```

  and `Oro\Bundle\FilterBundle\Form\Type\Filter\ManyToManyFilterType` classes.

#### ImportExportBundle
* The `unique_job_slug` MQ message parameter was removed for `oro.importexport.pre_import` topic. 

### SyncBundle
* Removed long-unused the `orosync/js/content/grid-builder` component from the layout updates.

#### UIBundle
* The `collectionField` TWIG macros was removed. Use the `form_row_collection` TWIG function instead.
  Before: `UI.collectionField(form.emails, 'oro.user.emails.label'|trans)`.
  After: `form_row_collection(form.emails)`.
  To change "add" button label use the `add_label` form option.
* Removed `cssVariablesManager.getVariables()` method as unused, and deleted dependency on the [jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill) library. 

#### UserBundle
* The `Oro\Bundle\UserBundle\Provider\PrivilegeCategoryProviderInterface` was removed.
  Use `Resources/config/oro/acl_categories.yml` files to configure ACL categories.
* Email template `user_reset_password_as_admin` has been removed. Use `force_reset_password` instead.

  was responsible to process this section was removed as well.
  This section was not used to build API that conforms JSON:API specification that is the main API type.
  In case if you need a special configuration for "plain" REST API, you can define it in
  `Resources/config/oro/api_plain.yml` configuration files or create a processor for the `get_config` action.

must be removed.

	If there are bower or npm dependencies (packages with names starting with `bower-asset/` or `npm-asset/`) specified in your `composer.json`, then do the following:

	1) for package names starting with `npm-asset/`: remove the `npm-asset/` prefix, move the dependency to the `extra.npm` section
  of `composer.json`;
	2) for package names starting with `bower-asset/`: remove the `bower-asset/` prefix, find the corresponding or alternative
 npm packages instead of bower packages, and add them to the `extra.npm` section of `composer.json`.

	If you have your own `package.json` with npm dependencies, then move them to the `extra.npm` section of `composer.json`.
	If you need a custom script to be executed as well, then you can add your custom script to the `scripts` section of `composer.json`.

  `{ name: oro.workflow.configuration.handler, priority: -100 }`



### Removed
* `*.class` parameters for all entities were removed from the dependency injection container.
The entity class names should be used directly, e.g. `'Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Entity\Email'`
instead of `'%oro_email.email.entity.class%'` (in service definitions, datagrid config files, placeholders, etc.), and
`\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Entity\Email::class` instead of `$container->getParameter('oro_email.email.entity.class')`

## 4.0.0 (2019-07-31)
[Show detailed list of changes](incompatibilities-4-0.md)


### Added

#### ApiBundle
* The class `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Request\ValueTransformer` (service ID is `oro_api.value_transformer`) was added
  to help transformation of complex computed values to concrete data-type for API responses.
  
#### UIBundle

* CSSVariable parser `oroui/js/css-variables-manager` has been add. Source module [css-variables-manager](./src/Oro/Bundle/UIBundle/Resources/public/js/css-variables-manager.js)

  Github link [https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill)

### Changed

#### ApiBundle
* The handling of HTTP response status code `403 Forbidden` was fixed. Now this status code is returned if there are
  no permissions to use an API resource. Before the fix `404 Not Found` status code was returned in both cases,
  when an entity did not exist and when there were no permissions to operate with it.
* The service `oro_api.entity_serializer.acl_filter` was renamed to `oro_api.entity_serializer.field_filter`.
* The method `normalizeObject` of `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Normalizer\ObjectNormalizer`
  was replaced with `normalizeObjects`.

#### CacheBundle
* The approach based on `Oro\Bundle\CacheBundle\Loader\ConfigurationLoader` and `Oro\Component\Config\Dumper\CumulativeConfigMetadataDumper` has been replaced with the approach based on `Oro\Component\Config\Cache\PhpConfigProvider`.

#### ChainProcessor component
* The interface `Oro\Component\ChainProcessor\ProcessorFactoryInterface` was replaced with
  `Oro\Component\ChainProcessor\ProcessorRegistryInterface`.
* The class `Oro\Component\ChainProcessor\ChainProcessorFactory` was removed.
  Use the decoration to create a chain of processor registries instead.

#### Config component
* The methods `load()` and `registerResources()` of class `Oro\Component\Config\Loader\CumulativeConfigLoader`
  were changed to not accept `Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder` as resources container.
  Use `Oro\Component\Config\Loader\ContainerBuilderAdapter` to adapt
  `Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder` to `Oro\Component\Config\ResourcesContainerInterface`.

#### EmailBundle
* The `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Provider\EmailRenderer` was reimplemented to support computed variables.
  The following changes were made:
    - remove extending of this class from `Twig_Environment`
    - method `renderWithDefaultFilters` was renamed to `renderTemplate`
    - move loading of configuration to `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Twig\Sandbox\TemplateRendererConfigProvider`
    - move rendering of template to `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Twig\Sandbox\TemplateRenderer`
    - move formatting of entity related variables to `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Twig\Sandbox\EntityFormatExtension`
* The interface `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Processor\VariableProcessorInterface` was moved to
  `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Twig\Sandbox\VariableProcessorInterface`.
  The method `process` was changed from `process($variable, array $definition, array $data = [])`
  to `process(string $variable, array $processorArguments, TemplateData $data): void`.
  This allows processors to add computed values.
* The interface `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Provider\SystemVariablesProviderInterface` was moved to
  `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Twig\Sandbox\SystemVariablesProviderInterface`.
  The method `getVariableDefinitions` was changed from `getVariableDefinitions()` to `getVariableDefinitions(): array`.
  The method `getVariableValues` was changed from `getVariableValues()` to `getVariableValues(): array`.
* The interface `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Provider\EntityVariablesProviderInterface` was moved to
  `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Twig\Sandbox\EntityVariablesProviderInterface`.
  The method `getVariableDefinitions` was changed from `getVariableDefinitions($entityClass = null)`
  to `getVariableDefinitions(): array`.
  The method `getVariableGetters` was changed from `getVariableGetters($entityClass = null)`
  to `getVariableGetters(): array`.
  By performance reasons new method `getVariableProcessors(string $entityClass): array` was added.
  If method `getVariableDefinitions` of your provider returns info about processors, move it to `getVariableProcessors`.
* Due to the updated version of `symfony/swiftmailer-bundle` parameter `mailer_transport: mail` is not supported anymore. Using old transport will cause such an exception -
 `Unable to replace alias “swiftmailer.mailer.default.transport.real” with actual definition “mail”.
  You have requested a non-existent service “mail”.` Please
  use `mailer_transport: sendmail` instead or another available swiftmailer transport type.

[Show detailed list of changes](incompatibilities-3-1.md)

### Added

#### ApiBundle
* Added `custom_fields` as a possible value for `exclusion_policy` option of `entities` section of `Resources/config/oro/api.yml`. This value can be used if it is required to exclude all custom fields (fields with `is_extend` = `true` and `owner` = `Custom` in `extend` scope in entity configuration) that are not configured explicitly.
* Enable filters for to-many associations. The following operators are implemented: `=` (`eq`), `!=` (`neq`), `*` (`exists`), `!*` (`neq_or_null`), `~` (`contains`) and `!~` (`not_contains`).
* Added [documentation about filters](https://doc.oroinc.com/3.1/backend/api/filters/#api-filters).
* Added data flow diagrams for public actions. See [Actions](https://doc.oroinc.com/3.1/backend/api/actions/#web-api-actions).
* Added `rest_api_prefix` and `rest_api_pattern` configuration options and `oro_api.rest.prefix` and `oro_api.rest.pattern` DIC parameters to be able to reconfigure REST API base path.
* Added trigger `disposeLayout` on DOM element in `layout`

#### AssetBundle
* `AssetBundle` replaces the deprecated `AsseticBundle` to build assets using Webpack.
It currently supports only styles assets. JS assets are still managed by [OroRequireJsBundle](https://doc.oroinc.com/3.1/backend/bundles/platform/RequireJSBundle/).


#### AttachmentBundle
* Added possibility to set available mime types from configuration.
To add or remove available mime types, add changes to the `upload_file_mime_types` section and `upload_image_mime_types` in the config.yml file:

```yml
oro_attachment:
    upload_file_mime_types:
        - application/msword
        - application/vnd.ms-excel
        - application/pdf
        - application/zip
        - image/gif
        - image/jpeg
        - image/png
    upload_image_mime_types:
        - image/gif
        - image/jpeg
        - image/png
```

#### DatagridBundle
* Added [Datagrid Settings](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/3.1/src/Oro/Bundle/DataGridBundle/Resources/doc/frontend/datagrid_settings.md) functionality for flexible managing of filters and grid columns

#### CacheBundle
* Added `oro.cache.abstract.without_memory_cache` that is the same as `oro.cache.abstract` but without using additional in-memory caching, it can be used to avoid unnecessary memory usage and performance penalties if in-memory caching is not needed, e.g. you implemented some more efficient in-memory caching strategy around your cache service.

#### SecurityBundle
* Added `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Test\Functional\RolePermissionExtension` trait that can be used in functional tests where you need to change permissions for security roles.

#### UIBundle
* Added the `addBeforeActionPromise` static method of `BaseController` in JS which enables to postpone route action if the required async process is in progress.


### Changed

#### AddressBundle
* Changes in `/api/addresses` REST API resource:
    - the attribute `created` was renamed to `createdAt`
    - the attribute `updated` was renamed to `updatedAt`
    
#### AssetBundle
* Syntax of `Resources/config/oro/assets.yml` files for the management-console was changed to follow the same standard as the configuration files for the OroCommerce storefront.
Use the `inputs` node instead of the group names.
```diff
- assets:
css:
-    'my_custom_asset_group':
+    inputs:
      - 'bundles/app/css/scss/first.scss'
      - 'bundles/app/css/scss/second.scss'
-    'another_asset_group':
      - 'bundles/app/css/scss/third.scss'
```
#### ApiBundle
* Fixed the `depends_on` configuration option of the `entities.fields` section of `Resources/config/oro/api.yml`. Now, only entity property names (or paths that contain entity property names) can be used in it.

### Changed

#### ApiBundle
* The `build_query` group was removed from `update` and `delete` actions. From now the updating/deleting entity is loaded by `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Processor\Shared\LoadEntity` processor instead of `Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Processor\Shared\LoadEntityByOrmQuery` processor.
* The priorities of some groups for the `update` action were changed. All changes are in the following table:

    | Group | Old Priority | New Priority |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | load_data | -50 | -40 |
    | transform_data | -60 | -50 |
    | save_data | -70 | -60 |
    | normalize_data | -80 | -70 |
    | finalize | -90 | -80 |
    | normalize_result | -100 | -90 |

* The priorities of some groups for the `delete` action were changed. All changes are in the following table:

    | Group | Old Priority | New Priority |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | load_data | -50 | -40 |
    | delete_data | -60 | -50 |
    | finalize | -70 | -60 |
    | normalize_result | -80 | -70 |

* Handling of `percent` data type in POST and PATCH requests was fixed. Before the fix, the percent value in GET and POST/PATCH requests was inconsistent; in POST/PATCH requests it was divided by 100, but GET request returned it as is. In this fix, the division by 100 was removed.
* For string filters the default value of the `allow_array` option was changed from `true` to `false`. This was done to allow filter data if a string field contains a comma.
#### DataGridBundle
* Parameter `count_hints` will have value of `hints` unless otherwise specified.
If other words from now
```yaml
datagrids:
    grid-name:
       ...
       source:
           ...
           hints:
               - SOME_QUERY_HINT
```
equivalent
```yaml
datagrids:
    grid-name:
       ...
       source:
           ...
           hints:
               - SOME_QUERY_HINT
           count_hints:
               - SOME_QUERY_HINT
```
#### SegmentBundle
* Refactored the `SegmentComponent` js-component to use `EntityStructureDataProvider`.
#### SidebarBundle
* In the `Oro\Bundle\SidebarBundle\Model\WidgetDefinitionRegistry` class, the return type in the `getWidgetDefinitions` and `getWidgetDefinitionsByPlacement` methods were changed from `ArrayCollection` to `array`.
#### UIBundle
* The `loadModules` method of the `'oroui/js/tools'` js-module now returns a promise object.
   * the element path is mostly turned off by default. It is turned on only in places where the status bar was enabled before. (edited)
