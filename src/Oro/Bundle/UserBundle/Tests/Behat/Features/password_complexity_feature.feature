Feature: Password complexity feature
  In order to increase safety of users
  As Administrator
  I need to define complexity of user passwords


  Scenario: Create sessions
    Given sessions active:
      | Admin | first_session  |
      | Buyer | second_session |
    And I change configuration options:
      | oro_user.password_min_length    | 4    |
      | oro_user.password_special_chars | true |
