Feature: Microsoft Azure Application configuration available
  In order to allow integration with Microsoft Azure application
  As an administrator
  I want to see be able to configure Microsoft Azure Application configurations

  Scenario: Saving Microsoft Azure Application Configuration
    Given I login as administrator
    When I go to System/ Configuration
    And I follow "System Configuration/Integrations/Microsoft Settings" on configuration sidebar
    And I should see "Redirect URI"
    And the "Enable Emails Sync" field should be disabled
    And uncheck "Use default" for "Client Secret" field
    And I fill form with:
      | Application (client) ID   | 12345         |
      | Client Secret             | 12345         |
      | Directory (tenant) ID     | SampleTenant  |
    And I save setting
    Then I should see "Configuration saved" flash message
    And the "Enable Emails Sync" field should be enabled

  Scenario: Saving empty Microsoft Integration configuration should disable Email, Calendar, Tasks checkboxes
    When I fill form with:
      | Application (client) ID   | |
      | Client Secret             | |
      | Directory (tenant) ID     | |
    And check "Use default" for "Client Secret" field
    And I save setting
    Then I should see "Configuration saved" flash message
    And the "Enable Emails Sync" field should be disabled

  Scenario: Saving Microsoft Integration configuration with its checked checkboxes values should save checkboxes values as well
    When uncheck "Use default" for "Client Secret" field
    And I fill form with:
      | Application (client) ID   | 12345         |
      | Client Secret             | 12345         |
      | Directory (tenant) ID     | SampleTenant  |
    And I check "Enable Emails Sync"
    And I save setting
    Then I should see "Configuration saved" flash message
    When I reload the page
    Then the "Application (client) ID" field should contain "12345"
    Then the "Client Secret" field should contain "*****"
    And the "Directory (tenant) ID" field should contain "SampleTenant"
    And the "Enable Emails Sync" checkbox should be checked
