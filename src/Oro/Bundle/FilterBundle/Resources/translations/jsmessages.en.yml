                In addition to exact dates, the filter supports entry of days and months.
                Delete the year from the date in order to filter records that fall into
                this date of any year (e.g. customers that have birthdays on November 15th);
                delete the year and the day to filter records by entire months
                (e.g. all orders placed between January and March). Both long and short month
                names are supported.
