# OroEntityExtendBundle

OroEntityExtendBundle enables the entities structure extension using UI or migration scripts without changing the entity definition class. The bundle also supports the creation of new entities (custom entities) using the UI.

For more information, please see [online documentation on extending entities](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/entities/extend-entities/).
