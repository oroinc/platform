  As an Administrator
  I want to create a select or multi-select entity field and define the list of its options

  Scenario: Feature Background
    Given I login as administrator
    And go to System/Entities/Entity Management

  Scenario: Can create Select field
    Given I filter Name as is equal to "User"
    And click View User in grid
    And click "Create Field"
    And fill form with:
      | Field name | selectField |
      | Type       | Select      |
    And click "Continue"
    And fill form with:
      | Label | Select Field |
    And set Options with:
      | Label    |
      | Option 1 |
      | Option 2 |
      | option 2 |
    And save and close form
    Then I should see "Field saved" flash message

      | Another Duplicate Option |

      | Another Option           |
    When I save and close form
    Then I should see "The options 'Duplicate Option 1', 'Another Duplicate Option' are duplicated."
